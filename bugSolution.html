```html
<div class="flex space-x-0">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2 flex-shrink-0 flex-grow-0"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2 flex-shrink-0 flex-grow-0"></div>
</div>
```
By adding `space-x-0` we ensure zero spacing between flex items.  Adding `flex-shrink-0` and `flex-grow-0` prevents items from shrinking or growing, which can also cause alignment issues.
