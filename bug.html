```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
</div>

This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a flexbox container with two equally sized divs. However, if you inspect the rendered output, you might notice that the divs aren't perfectly aligned side by side. There's a slight gap between them. This happens due to how browsers handle rounding errors with floating-point numbers in the calculation of flexbox sizes.
